## Slide 1

DealoAgent.ai

AI-powered Sales Agent & Competitor Intelligence

Founder: Oleksii Vinogradov

Website: DealoAgent.ai

## Slide 2

Problem

Modern sales teams drown in unstructured communication:

Emails, PDFs, and attachments remain unread and unused

Sales reps lose leads due to slow or missed follow-ups

No system connects competitor intelligence with outreach automation

Manual review of team–customer communication does not scale

Result: lost revenue, inconsistent sales quality, and poor visibility

---

## Slide 3

Competitor intelligence from emails, attachments, and chats

Automatic extraction of client data and contact info

AI-generated outreach sequences based on past conversations

Voice/Chat analysis: emotions, sentiment, and risk signals

Centralized history of all employees’ interactions with clients

Why Now?

Explosion of AI assistants, but few unify CRM, competitor analysis, and outreach

B2B buying generates massive email volume — ideal for AI automation

Sales teams must increase productivity without increasing headcount

Traditional CRMs remain manual and slow to adapt to AI workflows

DealoAgent.ai is AI-native CRM designed for the 2025+ sales stack

---

## Slide 7

Market

Total Addressable Market (TAM): CRM + AI Sales Automation + AI Analytics (~$186B+ by 2030)

Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): B2B teams using manual CRMs (~$22B+)

Target customers: SaaS, VoIP/SMS providers, agencies, real estate, B2B e‑commerce

Also targeting outsourced SDR teams and support organizations with heavy email volume

---

## Slide 8

Competitive Landscape

Most tools cover only 1–2 pieces of the value chain:

Apollo: CRM + outreach, limited competitor intelligence and no deep voice/chat AI

HubSpot: strong CRM, basic automation, but weak on AI-native competitor analysis

Clay & Lusha: strong data enrichment, but no end‑to‑end AI sales agent

DealoAgent.ai: unifies CRM, AI outreach, competitor intelligence, contact discovery, and voice/chat AI
