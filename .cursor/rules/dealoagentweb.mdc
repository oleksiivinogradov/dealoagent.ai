DealoAgent.ai is an AI-native sales CRM that turns your existing communication data into a 24/7 sales copilot. It connects to your email, messengers, and call channels, centralizes all conversations, and continuously analyses them to understand who your customers are, what they care about, and how your team sells today. Instead of staring at empty CRM fields, your team gets an always-up-to-date, automatically filled knowledge base about deals, contacts, and interactions.

On top of this foundation, DealoAgent.ai runs deep competitive intelligence. It reads incoming emails, proposals, and attachments from prospects and vendors, extracts pricing, features, and terms, and builds living comparison tables of your competitors — without any manual copy-paste. Your sales team sees where your offer wins or loses in seconds and can adapt messaging instantly instead of digging through old threads or spreadsheets.

For outreach, DealoAgent.ai uses past conversations and outcomes to generate personalized, context-aware messages for each lead or account. It learns what worked before, keeps tone and language consistent with your brand, and can draft full sequences for follow-ups and re-activation campaigns. The result is more relevant communication with less routine work and fewer “cold” messages that feel generic.

Over time, DealoAgent.ai evolves into a full AI sales agent, not just a reporting layer. It helps prioritize leads, suggests next best actions, highlights risky deals based on conversation signals, and can eventually handle parts of the communication loop end-to-end. You keep full control and visibility; the AI does the heavy lifting across analysis, outreach, and coaching so your human team can focus on closing deals and building relationships.
