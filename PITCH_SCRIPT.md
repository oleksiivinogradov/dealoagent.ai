# DealoAgent.ai - Mission Possible Batch 4 Pitch Script
**Time Limit:** 90 Seconds
**Speaker:** Alex Vinogradov

---

### (0:00-0:15) The Hook & Intro
**Visual:** Camera on Alex, confident smile.
**Audio:**
"Hi, I’m Alex Vinogradov, founder of DealoAgent.ai.
We all know the biggest lie in B2B sales: 'I’ll update the CRM later.' It never happens. Sales teams are drowning in admin work, missing critical competitive signals, and sending generic, cold outreach because they just don't have the time to be personal."

### (0:15-0:45) The Solution
**Visual:** Screen recording of DealoAgent automatically extracting data or generating an email.
**Audio:**
"That’s why I built DealoAgent.ai. It’s not just another database; it’s an AI-native sales copilot that lives where your communication happens.
It connects to your emails, calls, and messengers to build a living knowledge base. It reads incoming proposals to automatically build competitor comparison tables—so you know exactly how to win—and it uses that history to draft hyper-personalized outreach that actually converts."

### (0:45-0:75) Why You? (Traction & Vision)
**Visual:** Alex speaking with intensity/passion.
**Audio:**
"This isn't just a slide deck. DealoAgent is live. We have an MVP, we’re processing real data, and we’re already seeing how AI can turn a single sales rep into a team of ten.
I’m a technical founder who understands the sales workflow deeply. I’m building this because I’m tired of seeing brilliant sales teams fail because they’re stuck doing data entry instead of selling."

### (0:75-0:90) The Ask/Closing
**Visual:** Alex leans in slightly.
**Audio:**
"I’m ready to take DealoAgent from a live MVP to a category leader. I need the mentorship and network from Mission Possible to accelerate our go-to-market and fine-tune our strategy.
Let’s fix sales together. Thank you."
