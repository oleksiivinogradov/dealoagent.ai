Competitors were winning deals in the shadows because critical intelligence was buried in 500+ daily messages across Gmail, Slack, and LinkedIn.",

A healthcare company cared about HIPAA compliance; a tech startup wanted API integrations; an agency needed white-labeling.

Templates got 8% response rates. Personalized emails got 34%. But there was no time to personalize.",
