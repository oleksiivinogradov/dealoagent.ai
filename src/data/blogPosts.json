          "**Actual Pattern Recognition**: Most 'AI CRMs' just use keyword matching. DealoAgent uses advanced LLMs to understand context. When a prospect says 'We need better permissions,' it understands that's a compliance concern, maps it to Confluence's common objection pattern, and suggests the exact battle card that won 7 similar deals. That's real intelligence, not just search.",

Jessica could ask, 'Show me deals like the healthcare VP who mentioned Confluence and pricing,' and get instant results. No clicking, no reporting, no admin burden. This is why adoption would hit 100% on day one.",
